# Setup Instructions After Implementation

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Completed Jobs Feature ✅

A new administration feature to track successfully completed queue jobs.

## Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Run Migration

Run the migration to create the `completed_jobs` table:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create the table to store completed job records.

### Step 2: Clear Cache

Clear the application cache to ensure event listeners are registered:

```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan event:clear
```

### Step 3: Verify Queue Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file has the queue connection set:

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

### Step 4: Start Queue Worker

Make sure a queue worker is running to process jobs:

**Option 1 - Development:**
```bash
composer dev
```

**Option 2 - Manual:**
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

**Option 3 - Production (Supervisor):**
```bash
sudo cp .reward/supervisor-queue.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/cards-api-queue.conf
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
sudo supervisorctl start cards-api-queue-worker:*
```

## Accessing the Feature

1. Login to the admin panel as a **supervisor**
2. Navigate to **Administration > Completed Jobs**
3. You'll see all successfully processed queue jobs

## Email Configuration

### Gmail SMTP Setup

Your `.env` file has Gmail SMTP configured:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=signred@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@cardsforge.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Cards Forge"
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The password shown is your actual Gmail password. For security, you should:

1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on signred@gmail.com
2. Generate an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Replace the current password with the App Password
4. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   MAIL_PASSWORD="your-16-char-app-password"
   ```

## Testing Email Sending

Once the queue worker is running, test email sending:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Mail::raw('Test email from Cards Forge API', function($message) {
    $message->to('signred@gmail.com')->subject('Test Email');
});

echo "Email queued!\n";
exit
```

Check the Completed Jobs section in Filament to see if the email job was processed.
